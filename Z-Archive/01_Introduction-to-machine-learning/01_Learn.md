# Distance formula

Representing Points
In this lesson, you will learn three different ways to define the distance between two points:

- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Hamming Distance
Before diving into the distance formulas, it is first important to consider how to represent points in your code.

In this exercise, we will use a list, where each item in the list represents a dimension of the point. For example, the point (5, 8) could be represented in Python like this:

pt1 = [5, 8]
Points aren’t limited to just two dimensions. For example, a five-dimensional point could be represented as [4, 8, 15, 16, 23].

Ultimately, we want to find the distance between two points. We’ll be writing functions that look like this:

distance([1, 2, 3], [5, 8, 9])
Note that we can only find the difference between two points if they have the same number of dimensions!

- Create another point with four dimensions

`script.py`
```python
two_d = [10, 2]
five_d = [30, -1, 50, 0, 2]
four_d = [3,4,5,2]
```
